# Activities sample app

## Description

- You need to provide a backend application meant to expose an API (REST or GraphQL).
- You need to provide a client application consuming the API exposed by the previous application and implement a UI.
- The client should display the list of activities to the user and allow the user to search for activities by title by
  providing an input field.
  - The fields to be displayed are:
    - title
    - price with currency
    - rating
    - whether it has a special offer or not
    - the activity's supplier name and their location
- You need to decide if the filtering logic should be implemented on the client or on the server: please make sure you implement this business logic on the application that you would like to be reviewed.
- Please ensure that the FULL project can be run locally with the given Docker compose file with `docker compose up --build`. Modify, add any dependencies as required
- Add notes on your architectural decisions.
- Please also document any features/improvements you left out in favor of time, preferably with sufficient details on "what, why & how".
- Additionally, make sure any assumptions you made are noted down.
